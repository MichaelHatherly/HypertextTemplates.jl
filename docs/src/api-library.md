# Library Components API

The Library module provides a comprehensive set of pre-built UI components styled with Tailwind CSS. These components are designed to be accessible, responsive, and work seamlessly with dark mode. All components follow consistent design patterns and can be customized through props while maintaining sensible defaults.
