    @DropdownSubmenu

A nested submenu component that creates hierarchical flyout menus within dropdowns for organizing complex menu structures. Submenus are essential for creating multi-level navigation without overwhelming users with too many options at once. This component manages its own open state while coordinating with the parent dropdown, positions itself to the side of the parent menu item, and includes visual indicators like chevrons to show that it contains nested options. The submenu supports the same rich content as regular dropdown menus, enabling deep menu hierarchies while maintaining usability.

# Props
- `label::String`: The label for the submenu trigger
- `icon::Union{String,Nothing}`: Optional icon name
- `class::String`: Additional CSS classes
- `attrs...`: Additional attributes

# Slots
- Submenu items - typically @DropdownItem components

# Example
```julia
@DropdownSubmenu {label = "Export As"} begin
    @DropdownItem {icon = "document"} "PDF"
    @DropdownItem {icon = "file"} "CSV"
    @DropdownItem {icon = "code"} "JSON"
end
```

# Implementation Notes
The submenu uses Alpine Anchor for positioning. The key to making this work is the
x-anchor directive on the submenu content, which references its trigger button using
`\$el.previousElementSibling`. This works because:

1. The DOM structure places the trigger button immediately before the submenu content
2. `\$el` in the x-anchor context refers to the element with the directive (submenu content)
3. `previousElementSibling` reliably points to the trigger button
4. This avoids complex ref lookups that can fail due to Alpine scope boundaries

The submenu state is managed by the parent dropdown's Alpine component through the
`openSubmenus` object, allowing multiple submenus to be open simultaneously.

# Accessibility
**ARIA:** Maintains proper hierarchy for nested menus with expandable content indicators.

**Keyboard:** Arrow Right opens submenu, Arrow Left closes, Escape closes all menus.

**Focus Management:** Logical movement between menu levels with proper focus return.
